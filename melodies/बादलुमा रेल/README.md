बादलुमा रेल (train in the clouds) is a Teej Festival melody I heard when I was a kid, during the decade of 1990s. It is not certain who developed the lyrics. It was sung by a group of women at the river side of Narayani, in Narayanghat.

I tried to recreate the melody to preseve the memories. You can download the LMMS file and edit it yourself.
