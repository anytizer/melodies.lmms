# What is Teej?
Teej is a post monsoon seasoned women festival, massively celebrated in Nepal.
With red/green dress-ups, they gather to express their sad household feelings in a melodius manner.

Generally it is performed live with Madal and clappings. Often a harmonium is used.

Being old styled melody, this is a nostalgic tune for 80s and 90s generation from Nepal.
However, in this file, the instruments used are totally different.
And my work does not justify maintaining it's authenticity.

Every year, hundreds of such melodies are added to the YouTube like platform.
And, observed by millions of views around this theme.
