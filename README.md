# melodies.lmms
Melodies created in LMMS software, with source file.

## Project files structure
* lyrics/*.txt - lyrics file
* notations/*.txt - Sargam or English scale notes
* output/*.ogg - raw audio output
* project/*.mmpz - actual DAW file

The notations files are compatible with [swar.lmms](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms) application.
The swar.lmms project can produce .xpt XML Pattern files from sargam notations, for importing them into LMMS's piano editor.

## Raw Files
MMPZ is a compressed LMMS project file.
The raw files (*.mmpz) can be reopend in the software.
You can then edit each melodies.

## Did you improve?
Let me know back if you improved those melodies.

# Disclaimer
The tiny sound clips are default to LMMS 1.3 version, or otherwise:
* recorded by the author
* or, assumed free for at least tutotrial purpose (non commercial use)
* If you think they should be removed, please mention your issue to @anytizer.

# .ogg disclaimer
This is a sample audio output. It should NOT be cosndiered as the final version of the project. The .ogg file is attached with the project considering that some users amy want to listen or preview the audio before checking out the complete project folder. Since I do not know enough mixing and mastering, the provided audio is a reference only. It does not carry enough instrumental presets.

So, compile / regenerate your own beats!
