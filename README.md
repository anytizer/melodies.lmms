# melodies.lmms
Melodies created in LMMS software, with source file.

## Project files structure
* lyrics/*.txt - lyrics file
* notations/*.txt - Sargam or English scale notes eg. notations-sargams.txt
* output/*.ogg - raw audio output eg. 01.ogg
* project/*.mmpz - actual DAW file eg. project.mmpz

The notations files are made compatible with my other project - [swar.lmms](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms) application.
The swar.lmms project can produce .xpt XML Pattern files from sargam notations, for importing them into LMMS's piano editor.
This makes data entry easier within LMMS software.

The data entry has been already done in .mmpz files.
MMPZ is a compressed LMMS project file. You can reopen the project's corresponding .mmpz file in LMMS software in order to edit each melody.

## Did you improve?
Let me know back if you improved those melodies.

# Disclaimer
The tiny sound clips are default to LMMS 1.3 version, or otherwise:
* recorded by the author
* or, assumed free for at least tutotrial purpose (non commercial use)
* If you think they should be removed, please mention your issue to @anytizer.

# .ogg disclaimer
This is a default audio output format. It should NOT be cosndiered as the final version of the project. The .ogg file is attached with the project considering that some users amy want to listen or preview the audio before checking out the complete project folder. Since I do not know enough mixing and mastering, the provided audio is a reference only. It does not carry enough instrumental presets.

So, compile / regenerate your own beats!

# Mind your speakers
These LMMS files are made comatible on cup-foamed gaming headphones experience.
Mind your speakers, if you are playing too loud.

# Research | Experiement | Develop

If you make use of any of the materials in this project, please consider backlinking in your derivatives.

Thank you! Enjoy the raw beats!
