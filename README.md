# melodies.lmms
Melodies re-generatable in LMMS software, with source file.

## Project files structure
* lyrics/*.txt: lyrics file
* notations/*.txt: Sargam or English scale notes eg. notations-sargams.txt
* output/*.ogg:raw audio output eg. 01.ogg
* project/*.mmpz: actual DAW file eg. project.mmpz
* youtube.txt: Collection of video links around a project

## swar converter
The notations files are made compatible with my other project: [swar.lmms](https://github.com/anytizer/swar.lmms/) application.
That project can produce .xpt XML Pattern files from sargam notations, for importing them directly into LMMS's piano editor.
This makes data entry easier, faster and accurate.

The data entry has been already done in .mmpz files.
MMPZ is a compressed LMMS project file. You can reopen the project's corresponding .mmpz file in LMMS software in order to edit each melody.
Supplied .mmpz file may not contain enough presets. They are for melodies only.

## Did you improve?
Let me know back if you improved those melodies.

# Disclaimer
The tiny sound clips and audio instruments are default to LMMS 1.3 version, or otherwise:
* recorded by the author
* or, assumed free for at least tutotrial purpose (non commercial use)
* If you think they should be removed, please mention your issue to @anytizer.

# .ogg disclaimer
This is a default audio output format I chose. It should NOT be cosndiered as the final version of the project. The .ogg file is attached with the project considering that some users may want to listen or preview the audio before checking out the complete project folder.

Since I do not know enough mixing and mastering, the provided audio is for a reference only. It does not carry enough instrumental presets.

Compile / regenerate / improve your own beats!

# Mind your speakers
These LMMS files are made comatible on cup-foamed gaming headphones experience.
Mind your speakers, if you are playing too loud.

# Research | Experiement | Develop
A lot of researches are made, experimentations done, data entries made, and applications developed to raise this project.
If you make use of any of the materials in this project, please consider backlinking in your derivatives.

Thank you! Enjoy the raw beats!

# Copyrights?

Yes, there could be.

I have tried to collborate the collection of melodies in order to preseve them.
It takes several days to improve a melody, and I tend to supply as much information as possible.
This includes source of melody (original websites, tutorials, videos), author's contact information, improviser's views, and some stories behind the oroginal work.

So copyrights may still remain with known or unknown team of original workers for their contributions, even if the team mate has decesead.
